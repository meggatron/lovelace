# Different set of phrases
examples = ["Python is powerful", "Lists are versatile", "Coding is fun", "Learn every day"]

# Loop through phrases and create the visual representation

#ASSIGNMENTS

#1. create different variables for circle and line, experiment: try symbols or longer strings.
#2. uncomment the second half of spaces in the if statement and modify the integer
